    /// <summary>Specifies the workflow state of the submittal item associated with the attachment. If omitted, the system assigns one based on the current state.Note that you can only set category IDs ``1``-``4`` when adding an attachment. Category IDs ``5``-``8`` are system-generated and appear in responses for historical records.In some cases, you must manually set ``categoryId``:1. Subcontractor Submissions:When a subcontractor creates an item in the ``Open (Submitted) - (mgr-1)`` state,  set ``categoryId`` to ``1`` (**Submission**) instead of ``2`` (**For Review**).2. Final Response in Non-Standard Closures:When closing an item from a state other than ``Open (Reviewed) - (mgr-2)``, set ``categoryId`` to ``4`` (**Final Response**) if uploading a final response.Possible values:- ``1``: **Submission** – Initial submission.- ``2``: **For Review** – Submitted and awaiting review.- ``3``: **Review Response** – A response provided during review.- ``4``: **Final Response** – The final response in the submittal workflow.To retrieve the list of available category ID values, call `GET metadata &lt;/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/submittals-metadata-GET/&gt;`_ and refer to the attachment categories list in the response.</summary>
