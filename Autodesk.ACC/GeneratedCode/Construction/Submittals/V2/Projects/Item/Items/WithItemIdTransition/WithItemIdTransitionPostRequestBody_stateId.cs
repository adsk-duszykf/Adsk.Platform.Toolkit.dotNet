    /// <summary>Specifies the target state to which the submittal item will transition according to the user&apos;s permitted actions. To determine available transitions, call `GET Item/:id &lt;/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/submittals-items-itemId-GET/&gt;`_ and check the ``permittedActions`` field.Note that submittal items cannot be transitioned to a ``draft - (Draft)`` state, only from a ``draft - (Draft)`` state to another state.To transition a submittal item to a ``rev - (Open - In Review)`` state, the associated template must include predefined steps and tasks, and a custom identifier must already be set. See the `Create Submittal Items &lt;/en/docs/acc/v1/tutorials/submittals/create-submittal-item/&gt;`_ tutorial (step 6) for more details.Possible values:``sbc-1`` (Waiting for Submission) – Assigned to the Responsible Contractor, who needs to submit the submittal to the Manager.``mgr-1`` (Open - Submitted) – Assigned to the Manager, who needs to prepare it for review.``rev`` (Open - In Review) – Under review by the reviewers defined in the submittal workflow.``mgr-2`` (Open - Reviewed) – The review is complete, and the submittal is returned to the Manager, who needs to set the final response and close the submittal.``sbc-2`` (Closed) – The submittal has been closed and assigned to the Responsible Contractor.``void`` (Voided): The item has been voided.</summary>
